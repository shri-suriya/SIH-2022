        <p>After a series of natural calamities including, the Orissa Super Cyclone (1999), Gujarat Earthquake (2001)
            and Indian Ocean Tsunami (2004), among many others, the concerned authorities took necessary steps towards
            designing a systematic disaster management plan. This led to the enactment of the Disaster Management Act on
            December 26, 2005.

            The Disaster Management Act has statutory provisions for the constitution of the National Disaster Response
            Force (NDRF) for the purpose of specialized response to natural and man-made disasters. The practice of
            “proactive availability” of this Force to the States and that of “pre-positioning”, in a threatening
            disaster situations have immensely helped minimise damage, caused due to natural calamities in the country.
        </p><br></br><br></br>
        <h2>National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) </h2><br></br>
        <p>Currently, NDRF is made up of 12 Battalions. Each Battalion consists of 1149 personnel.  Of these, three each
            from the BSF and CRPF and two each from CISF, ITBP and SSB. NDRF was constituted as per Section 44-45, of
            Disaster Management Act, 2005. This Bill was passed in Parliament in the year 2005. President of India gave
            his assent to the Bill in 2006. </p><br></br><br></br>
